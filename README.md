# brickviking

Hi. I'm brickviking, author of the rfcshow and minecrafty projects.

### rfcshow
A front end for displaying RFC/STD/BCP/FYI documents from [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).

Features:
* fetch documents from remote sites, usually the ftp version of [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
* store them locally (preferably compressed)
* provide search functions
* display required documents
* update documents as new ones are found

Current issues:
Ancient. Needs updating badly.

### Dolphin Smalltalk

This has been forked from the parent project. See [that repository](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin) instead for important changes.

Dolphin Smalltalk was a commercial product from Object Arts, and featured a high level of integration with the Windows operating system. It has since been made open source under the MIT licence. Its development is ongoing.

### minecrafty

Fetches or executes most common Minecraft launchers.

Source code can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty), contributions will be considered seriously. The main page can be accessed here, and a wiki is also available.
