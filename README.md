# brickviking

Hi. I'm brickviking, author of the rfcshow and minecrafty projects.

### rfcshow

A front end for displaying RFC/STD/BCP/FYI documents from [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/rfcshow)

Features:
* fetch documents from remote sites, usually the ftp version of [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
* store them locally (preferably compressed)
* provide search functions
* display required documents
* update documents as new ones are found

Current issues:
Ancient. Needs updating badly.

### Dolphin Smalltalk


Dolphin Smalltalk was a commercial product from Object Arts, and featured a high level of integration with the Windows operating system. It has since been made open source under the MIT licence. Its development is ongoing. This version has been forked from the parent project. 

Source: See [that repository](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin) instead for important changes.


### minecrafty

Fetches or executes most common Minecraft launchers.

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty)

Wiki: [available here](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty/wiki)

Features:
* retrieve common minecraft launchers (minecraft, ATL, FTB, MultiMC, Technic etc)
* execute launchers
* change monitor brightness/gamma/resolution
