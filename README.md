# brickviking

Hi. I'm brickviking, author of the rfcshow and minecrafty projects.

### rfcshow

A front end for displaying RFC/STD/BCP/FYI documents from [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/rfcshow)

Features:
* fetch documents from remote sites, usually the ftp version of [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
* store them locally (preferably compressed)
* provide search functions
* display required documents
* update documents as new ones are found

Current issues:
Ancient. Needs updating badly.

### Dolphin Smalltalk


Dolphin Smalltalk was a commercial product from Object Arts, and featured a high level of integration with the Windows operating system. It has since been made open source under the MIT licence. Its development is ongoing. This version has been forked from the parent project. 

Source: See [that repository](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin) instead for important changes.


### minecrafty

Fetches or executes most common Minecraft launchers.

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty)

Wiki: [available here](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty/wiki)

Features:
* retrieve common minecraft launchers (minecraft, ATL, FTB, MultiMC, Technic etc)
* execute launchers
* change monitor brightness/gamma/resolution
* create or append to output file for debugging
* configure pulseaudio to use alsa instead

Current issues:
* some launchers are out of date
* fetching code has become superfluous
* "start server" code is locked to one filename

### atom-presunset

This is a snapshot of the atom editor source code before the original atom/atom was sunsetted and archived.

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/atom-presunset)

No wiki available. Yet.

Features:
* provides an editor that has roughly the same features as VSCode, if you don't look too hard
* It used to have support for plugins, before the server for those was shut down. There are alternatives if you're prepared to look.

Liabilities:
* Built on Electron. This used to be an advantage, now it's not seen as one any more as other platforms have overtaken Electron for speed.
* No longer supported by Microsoft. However, [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar) and others forked the project to continue.
* Support for the original Atom editor from subsequent forkers. There is none, in essence. There is no guarantee of fixes.
