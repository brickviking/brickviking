# brickviking

Hi. I'm brickviking, author of the rfcshow and minecrafty projects. Many of my other projects are listed here,
or in the Repositories link reached from [here](https://github.com/brickviking).

### vimmaker/emacsmake

Two compiling front ends for the latest vim or emacs source trees. It features the ability to fetch the latest
git revision of the editor, and compile various versions of the vim and emacs editors. Run `vimmaker help`
or `emacsmake help` for further details. If you want the gnarlies, read the org documents from within Emacs,
as that's the best place to use it.

### nqbn2emacs

A quirky acronym for the Not-Quite-Brand-New-To-Emacs (and vim) guide for those of you who have learned to
start up and shut down your editor without pulling the plug out of the wall. It provides several useful things
that I've either discovered or been told about over the years for both the emacs and vim editors, as well as
a small miscellany of other things. The best way to use this is to download the org document and load it up inside
a recent version of emacs with org-mode. A version of org-mode also exists for the vim editor, though that is not
as fully-featured.

### rfcshow

A front end for displaying RFC/STD/BCP/FYI documents from [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/rfcshow)

Features:
* fetch documents from remote sites, usually the ftp version of [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
* store them locally (preferably compressed)
* provide search functions
* display required documents
* update documents as new ones are found

Current issues:
Ancient. Needs updating badly.

### Dolphin Smalltalk

Dolphin Smalltalk was a commercial product from Object Arts, and featured a high level of integration with the Windows operating system. It has since been made open source under the MIT licence. Its development is ongoing. This version has been forked from the parent project. 

Source: See [that repository](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin) instead for important changes,
as I have not kept up to date with this project due to inability to run this on my machine.


### minecrafty

Fetches or executes most common Minecraft launchers.

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty)

Wiki: [available here](https://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty/wiki)

Features:
* retrieve common minecraft launchers (minecraft, ATL, FTB, MultiMC, Technic etc)
* execute launchers
* change monitor brightness/gamma/resolution
* create or append to output file for debugging
* configure pulseaudio to use alsa instead

Current issues:
* some launchers are out of date
* fetching code has become superfluous
* "start server" code is locked to one filename

### atom-presunset

This is a snapshot of the atom editor source code before the original atom/atom was sunsetted and archived.

Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/brickviking/atom-presunset)

No wiki available. Yet.

Features:
* provides an editor that has roughly the same features as VSCode, if you don't look too hard
* It used to have support for plugins, before the server for those was shut down. There are alternatives if you're prepared to look.

Liabilities:
* Built on Electron. This used to be an advantage, now it's not seen as one any more as other platforms have overtaken Electron for speed.
* No longer supported by Microsoft. However, [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar) and others have forked the project to continue its legacy.
* Support for the original Atom editor from subsequent forkers. There is none, in essence. There is no guarantee of fixes.
