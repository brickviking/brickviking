# brickviking

Hi. I'm brickviking, author of the rfcshow and minecrafty projects.

### rfcshow
A front end for displaying RFC documents.

Features:
* fetch documents from remote sites, [usually the ftp version of rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
* store them locally (preferably compressed)
* provide search functions
* display required documents
* update documents as new ones are found

### Dolphin Smalltalk

This has been forked from the parent project. See that repository instead for important changes.

Dolphin Smalltalk was a commercial product from Object Arts, and featured a high level of integration with the Windows operating system. It has since been made open source under the MIT licence. Its development is ongoing.

### minecrafty

Fetches or executes most common Minecraft launchers.

Source code can be downloaded from here, contributions will be considered seriously. The main page can be accessed here, and a wiki is also available.
